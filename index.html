		<h2>whats happening?</h2>
			<p>basically this is a funky little site where I talk about different fandom interpretations of the sp kids! </p>
			<p> let me mention that none of these will ever be accurate or representative enough of both how many different types of interpretations there are of the canon, and the canon itself.</p>
			<p> canon is confusing enough as it is, so i can't really say what exactly could be considered a "canon" version of the character. either way it would be considered wrong and right, just like all the other fan's interpretations of the characters.</p> 
			<p> please don't be like me and get confused and overwhelmed by everyone's different views and opinions of the characters along with the creator's possible intentions. just have fun with your version of all the characters! you'll never be able to get it 100% canon anyways since canon is a mix of opinions (that are also partially decided by the fans) and are too complex to both decipher and follow 100% correctly. like i said, just have fun! </p>

				 <h2>if you're vaguely familiar with south park</h2>
			<p>first of all, welcome to this chaotic comedy show!</p>
			<!-- see if you even need to have this explaination -->
			<p> i'm gonna go ahead and give a little summery for some of the terms and characters i'm talking about, since some people might not know of the lesser know characters, and some might not know fandom terms</p>
			<h2> terms </h2>
			<li> fandom </li>
			<p> refers to the group of fans consuming the work of media</p>
			<li> ship</li>
			<p> refers to the romantic relationship between two characters</p>
			<li>canon </li>
			<p> what is a fact of the show, for instance, directly quoting a line from the show, that line of diologue is considered canon. fanon refers to the fan's interpretation of the canon.</p>
			<li>craig's gang </li>
			<p> refers to clyde and token </p>
			<h2> ships </h2>
			<li> creek</li>
			<p> tweek x craig </p>
			<li> bunny </li>
			<p> kenny x butters</p>
			<li> crenny</li>
			<p> kenny x craig</p>
			<h2> characters</h2>
			<li> craig</li>
			<p> a stoic boy who speaks with a monotone voice, usually known to be cold and flip people off. he's revealed to be quite sweet on the inside, shown by his canon relationship with tweek. </p>
			<li> tweek</li>
			<p> a very anxious boy thats known to jitter all the time. he's paranoid, but in no way mean spirited, yet not afraid to be savage at times.</p>
			<li> kenny</li>
			<p> a quiet kid that rarely shows his face or lets his voice be comprihensible. he has unsual knowledge of dirty subjects and enjoys dirty humour. he's a good kid, albiet a little chaotic, and is often ready to sacrifice himself for his friends. </p>
			
			<li> clyde</li>
			<p> a chubby sensitive kid who often cries, but is mostly overconfident and flirty. generally a good kid.</p>
			<li> token </li>
			<p> a humble rich kid who generally has only good intentions. a lovely kid.</p>
