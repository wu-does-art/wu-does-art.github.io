			<p>fanon 1: the edgy asshole </p>
			
			<li> personality </li>
			<p>edgy craig (mostly depicted this way in fanfiction), generally acts cold and cruel to others in a way that feels quite forein to his character. in the worst case senario, he's quite abusive and toxic to those around him. he is also often depicted consuming drugs with kenny at parties. this interpretation makes him quite annoying and grills him down to being only cold and mean, taking away a lot of his other, more interesting traits in canon.</p>
			<li> relationships </li>
			<p> tweek </p>
			<p> usually between them in this case, there is a range between abuse and favouritism. either Craig only cares about him, or he doesn't treat him well at all.</p> 
			<p>craig's gang </p>
			<p>if they are still friends at all, it is usually dipicted that they are a trouble making gang, a little like stan's group but much more deliquent-like. either he cares about them and no-one else, or he doesn't care for them at all </p>
			<p>kenny</p>
			<p>usually this craig seems neutral to kenny, but thats possibly because in fanfiction he is the main source of his drugs, like weed and alcohol. other than that, both are depicted as enjoying making trouble together.</p>
			<li>appearence</li>
			<img src="edgy creg.png" alt="a drawing of this criag's depiction. compared to canon craig's design, he has two bottom lip peircings, an older appearence and edgier clothes, plus a scowling expression to finish it off. for those who are reading/listening to this, the artist who drew it appreciates it since they feel they can describe better than draw..">

			<p>fanon 2: mostly in character</p>
			<li> personality</li>
			<p> this criag resembles a mixture of canon craig and the former fanon craig I mentioned. he's his stoic but loveable self, with a varying degree of fandom traits added. usually that factor is how edgy he'll be.</p>
			<li>relationships</li>
			<p>tweek</p>
			<p>quite similar to canon! craig will mainly be fair to tweek, but lacking in understanding to his open emotions. he's generally a good boyfriend to him, but that depends on what fanfiction you're reading.</p>
			<p> craig's gang</p>
			<p>this craig's relationship with his group is mildly (or not) exaggerated, but its done usually in the best way possible. </p>
			<p>unlike in the show, "mostly in character" craig will have a very full and dynamic relationship with his group, usually being supported by them, and returning the favour later on, albiet reluctantly.</p>
				
			<p>token stands as the mom, tweek and craig are the nervous couple, and jimmy and clyde stand as the source of chaos and dumbassery. just like the former entries though, depending on the content, it varies whether craig will be an edgy asshole or not.</p>
<p>kenny</p>
			<p> also a little unlike canon, this craig seems to have a pretty full friendship with kenny. half for drugs, other half for chaos, and the rest is history. depending on kenny's depiction, they're usually teasing eachother in a friendly manner, or craig is just plain annoyed by his constant flirting. otherwise, uncommonly there is a place that kenny actually assists craig with emotional and romantic advice, and serves as a good outlet. (this is only used in like. a 10% of crenny fanfiction)</p>
			<li>appearence</li>
			<img src="craig 2 slightly better.png" alt="a fairly normal image of craig, the only general difference to canon is that he looks like a teen and has a cigerette and an ear peircing">

	<h2>summary (just my opinions,,)</h2>
	<p>overall, craig is a character that isn't *too* often depicted badly, which makes me very happy , because he is a really fantastic character! I hate to see him mischaracterised as an abusive asshole, even though its uncommon from what i've read- (thats not saying much, i primarily read bunny and almost nothing else). people usually manage to get craig's soft side and his edgy side, but of course whats that without a bit of random smoking in it? all in all, the fandom aren't too bad with him! i'm glad most of the creek and craig centric fanfics/comics/art i've consumed are all really fun and mostly in character! </p>
	<p>final assesment: keep on going fandom! you're doing your best!</p>
