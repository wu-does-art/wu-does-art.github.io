			<p>fanon 1: local druggie and playboy</p> <!-- i don't wanna say whore because ummm school? i don't wanna say sex either for same reason. -->
			
			<li> personality </li>
			<p> oh my god where do i even start? i am really REALLY sick of this dipiction of kenny. fanfics, art, either are just as bad.</p>
			
			<p>this kenny is just plain annoying. he's just your general overconfident flirty pretty boy. loud, always making dirty jokes, always turning every sentence into a flirty remark. he doesn't shut up. ever. sometimes its so bad, that even if under all that, the author depicts some good aspects of his personality (like his compassion ect), it hardly even registers because of how goddamn annoying he is. not only this, but he's always doing drugs! smoking, getting high on weed, you name it! (he's aged up when this happens do not worry). he's too stoned or annoying to take seriously. theres only been some rare occasions where the author gets a good balance of the flirtyness and his good naturedness. overall: ugh. </p>
			
			<li> relationships</li>
			
			<h3> i won't explain tweek and craig here, since both have their relationship with kenny mentioned in their pages. </h3>
			<p> </p>
			<p> Butters </p>
			
			<p> ah yes the main ship. depending on how strongly this kenny's traits is presented, it could either be a disaster or not, but never anything abusive (and i know that for a fact, i've read a LOT of bunny fanfics). </p>
			
			<p> usually the two complement eachother almost perfectly, both having a good, balanced relationship. mostly however bad the depiction of kenny is, whenever he interacts with butters, the bad traits make way for the good ones. and then he's back on his bullshit. theres been still a fair few times i've seen kenny just be outright gross (language wise. he's otherwise respectable) when in the presence of butters. its the flirting, just lots of weird remarks. but generally their relationship is done real well no matter kenny's charcter depiction. </p>
			
			<p> Stan </p> 
			
			<p> really all of these depend on the ship depicted in the fanfiction. so lets talk fanart first. with stan kenny usually has an average relationship. pretty simple, kenny's being a flirt and Stan groans (me too stan.), usually not wanting to be involved with whatever sexual innuendo he's refering to. they tend to still be good friends though, either way. </p> 
			
			<p> kyle</p>
			
			<p> even if he's a dumb flirt, kyle generally seeks advice from this depiction of kenny. they'll usually sit down in kyle's room, kyle will rant about stan and kenny will offer suprisingly good advice, and then make a flirty remark after kyle's pleased with what kenny responded with.</p>
			
			<li> appearence</li>
			<img src="thats not my boi.png" alt="a picture of kenny i drew, depicting him with a smug look, one hand doing a peace sign and the other holding a cigerette. he's not wearing his hood, unlike canon kenny. you can tell i put more effort in this one haha">

			<p>fanon 2: cartman the second (usually only in fanfiction)</p>
			<li> personality</li>
			<p> basically the previous kenny but worse. this time, he has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. the author was clearly trying to write some of his good-heartedness in there, but it just. didn't work. he's an asshole, always doing mean spirited pranks and causing problems on purpose. not to say that canon kenny doesn't commit some chaos occasionally, but 1. he's 10, and in the fanfics he is not, and 2. its usually done only when theres outside influence. so all in all this is just down right out of character. </p>
			
			<li> relationships</li>
			
			<p> craig</p>
			
			<p> i'm only putting craig in here, no one else, because i usually see this type of kenny only in creek fanfiction.</p>
			
			<p> usually this kenny serves as an advice giver to craig, but he's garbage at it, only really being mean to craig when he needs assitance confessing to tweek. </p>
			
			<li>appearence</li>
			<p> this kenny basically looks the same as the previous, but i wouldn't know anyways since this kenny's only really in fanfiction, otherwise its just canon depiction in fanfart, just slightly meaner.</p>

			<h2> summery</h2>
			<p> fandom kenny is a mess. it scares me that 90% of people write him like some party loving extrovert who flirts every 5 seconds and doesn't shut up. look at canon my dudes! he is NOT that overly confident or chatty. he retains SOME traits that fandom potrays, but i feel like its blown up to such a degree thatfandom kenny is a different person entirely. it would be really fantastic if i saw more focus of kenny's interesting traits and confict with his dying curse. though i applaud the bunny fanfic writers to make their relationship good and bearable to read most of the time. </p>
			
			<p> final assesment: *sighs* you can make him a bit of a flirt i don't care, but like. keep his quiet trait, its a big part of him. i don't know how ya'll got from "barely speaks" to "doesn't shut up".</p>
